# giantswarm-platform-manager

Giant Swarm's **installation manager**: enables, reconciles and verifies platform capabilities on
opted-in installations as the person, through MCP tools behind muster. Every write is a pull request
to the installation's GitOps repository, opened as the person; nothing is applied to a cluster
directly.

`giantswarm-platform-manager` is the working name. The `giantswarm-` prefix marks a manager specific
to the giantswarm org — like `giantswarm-repo-manager`, unlike `agent-manager`, `model-manager` and
`cluster-manager` — and *installation manager* is its alias in the platform's plans. The final name
is the team's; a rename is one repository rename plus the GitHub App's.

It ships as its own app on the hub installation, never as a component of the `agent-platform` meta
chart.

## Identities

The server holds no token of its own, verifies no Dex token and is no muster broker client.

- **The caller is the person.** Behind muster every request carries the person's GitHub user token —
  their one-time authorization of the GitHub App `giantswarm-platform-manager`, which muster stores,
  refreshes and puts on every call. The server verifies the bearer with `GET /user` (once per token,
  then from a bounded cache) and every GitHub call of the request runs with it. A request without a
  bearer, or with one GitHub refuses, is a bare `401` with the RFC 6750 challenge naming the
  protected-resource metadata; there is no other path in.
- **A write's effective rights are the person's own ∩ the App's.** The pull request is the person's;
  GitHub bounds it to what the person may do and to what the App is installed on and permitted.
- **Unattended runs, when they come, act as the platform's App identity**, never as a person.

The chart's `MCPServer` (with `muster.mcpServer.enabled` and `oauth.enabled`) renders `auth.type:
oauth` pinned to the App as the authorization server — issuer `https://github.com/apps/giantswarm-platform-manager`,
GitHub's authorize and token endpoints, the App's client credentials from a Secret, `grantScope:
subject` so every session of a person carries the same grant — the pattern of the `github` and `pro`
servers on the platform.

## Tools

Behind muster the tools appear as `x_giantswarm-platform-manager_<tool>`.

| Tool | Kind | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `get_info` | read | The version, the caller (login and id), the pinned authorization server, the capability definitions with their input schemas, the write modes, the write tools, the approval channel configuration and the tools still to come. Call first. |
| `list_installations` | read | Every installation of the registry with, per capability, its state, the inputs on record and the last action; the opt-in declaration read at call time. `installations` (names) and `customer` narrow the answer. |
| `enable_capability`, `reconcile_capability`, `verify_capability`, `get_action`, `list_actions` | planned | The extension points the next slices fill; `get_info` lists them as `plannedTools` until each is registered. |

Every write tool is registered through one framework, which owns two arguments:

- `dryRun: true` returns the rendered change and writes nothing;
- `mode: "commit"` opens the pull request as the person — the only write mode;
- `mode: "apply"` **is refused for every write tool, present and future**, before the tool runs: every
  target of this manager is GitOps-owned, and a change applied without its commit is drift the next
  reconcile reverts. `get_info` reports `capabilities: {commit: true, apply: false, applyRefused: true}`.

## The registry

`list_installations` knows every installation from two sources, both read as the caller at call
time:

- **the installations catalog** — `catalog/installations.yaml` in the registry repository
  (`registry.repository` / `--registry-repository`, `giantswarm/github` by default): a Backstage
  catalog file with one `Resource` of `spec.type: installation` per installation. The manager reads
  its name, the labels `giantswarm.io/customer`, `giantswarm.io/provider`, `giantswarm.io/pipeline`
  and `giantswarm.io/region`, the annotations `giantswarm.io/base` (the base domain is
  `<name>.<base>`) and `giantswarm.io/account-engineer`, and the links of type `CCR` (the
  `<customer>-configs` repository) and `CMC` (the `<customer>-management-clusters` repository). An
  installation whose entry names no repositories is listed and read no further.
- **the Dev Portal's app-config** — `management-clusters/<hub>/extras/backstage/backstage/app-config.yaml`
  in the hub's management-clusters repository, as the catalog names it: the `gs.installations` block
  (base domain, providers, auth provider). The hub is `hub` / `--hub`, the installation this manager
  runs on.

Because the catalog lives in a repository of its own, **the GitHub App `giantswarm-platform-manager`
must be installed on the registry repository with contents read** — next to the customer
`-configs`/`-management-clusters` pairs, the hub pair and `teleport-fleet` — and the caller must be
able to read it. Without that, `list_installations` refuses with the requirement; the manager never
steps in with a token of its own.

Per installation the manager then reads, as the caller:

- the **opt-in declaration** `management-clusters/<name>/platform-manager.yaml` in its
  management-clusters repository (below);
- the **facts on record** in `installations/<name>/config.yaml.patch` of its configs repository —
  `managementCluster.private`, the meta chart line (`agentPlatform.kagentApiV2` selects `4`),
  `services.muster.clientId` — which, with the registry's name, base domain, customer and provider,
  are the definitions' `installation.*` inputs: read, never typed;
- the **enabled marker** of each capability: for `agent-platform`,
  `installations/<name>/apps/agent-platform/configmap-values.yaml.patch`.

The state per capability is *not opted in* (no declaration, or `optIn: false`), *not enabled* (opted
in, marker absent) or *enabled* (opted in, marker present). *Pending approval*, *rolling out*,
*waiting for the customer*, *drifted* and *failed* come from the Action record and the last verify
once those exist; the answer's `states` block separates the two groups. An installation whose
repositories the caller cannot read is *unknown* and listed under `unreadable`, with the reason.

### The opt-in declaration

The installation's owners' standing consent that the manager may open pull requests for the
installation's platform capabilities. It is landed by the owners' own pull request in the
installation's management-clusters repository — never by this manager, which would be consenting
on their behalf — at `management-clusters/<name>/platform-manager.yaml`, read at call time and
never cached. Absent or `optIn: false`, the installation is *not opted in* and every answer names
the file's path and the pull request that would add it. The file is not in the directory's
`kustomization.yaml`: Flux never applies it.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "title": "platform-manager.yaml — an installation's opt-in for giantswarm-platform-manager",
  "type": "object",
  "additionalProperties": false,
  "required": ["optIn"],
  "properties": {
    "optIn": {
      "type": "boolean",
      "description": "true: the manager may open pull requests for this installation's platform capabilities, as the person calling it. false or absent: every tool is read-only for the installation."
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration

Flags, each with an environment variable (`--listen` / `LISTEN`, `--mcp-path` / `MCP_PATH`,
`--github-api-url` / `GITHUB_API_URL`, `--enable-oauth` / `OAUTH_ENABLED`, `--oauth-base-url` /
`OAUTH_BASE_URL`, `--oauth-authorization-server` / `OAUTH_AUTHORIZATION_SERVER`, `--approvals-url` /
`APPROVALS_URL`, `--approvals-channel` / `APPROVALS_CHANNEL`, `--registry-repository` / `REGISTRY_REPOSITORY`,
`--registry-path` / `REGISTRY_PATH`, `--hub` / `HUB_INSTALLATION`); `giantswarm-platform-manager -h` lists
them. The chart in [`helm/giantswarm-platform-manager`](helm/giantswarm-platform-manager/README.md)
sets them from its values.

## Development

- `make test` — the Go tests, among them the scenarios in `internal/e2e` against a fake GitHub: the
  identity chain (no bearer is a bare 401, a refused bearer is `invalid_token`, `get_info` names the
  person, the bearer is verified once per token, the framework refuses `mode: apply`) and
  `list_installations` over an invented registry — an installation in each state the repositories
  can show, one whose repositories the caller may not read, one the portal alone knows, the opt-in
  read on every call, the filters, a registry the caller cannot read, a call without a caller.
- `make scenario-test` — the muster half in muster's own scenario harness (`tests/scenarios`, needs
  the `muster` binary on `PATH`): a mock authorization server standing in for GitHub as the App, the
  consent once, the token on every call, a second session adopting the grant, a person without a
  grant told where to sign in. CI runs both in the `scenario-test` job (`.circleci/custom.yml`).
- `make helm-lint`, `make helm-template`, `make helm-schema` — the chart with its default, platform
  (`tests/oauth-values.yaml`) and lab (`tests/lab-oauth-values.yaml`) values.
- `make docker-build` — a local image; CI builds and publishes the multi-arch image and the chart on
  every tag.

Public repository: every fixture uses invented installation names and placeholder values.
